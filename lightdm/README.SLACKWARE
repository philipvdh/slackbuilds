README.SLACKWARE for lightdm

If you would like to use lightdm as the login manager in runlevel 4, add the
following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.4 just above the section that tries to 
start gdm:

  # Try to use lightdm login manager.  This comes first, because if lightdm is 
  # installed, then the user probably wants to use it by default:
  if [ -x /usr/bin/lightdm ]; then
    exec /usr/bin/lightdm
  fi
