SlackBuild for lightdm

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/LightDM/

This needs pam, it was tested with Willy's Connamon SlackBuilds:
https://cinnamonslackbuilds.github.io/

This requires a lightdm user and group which can be created like so:
# groupadd -g 800 lightdm
# useradd -d /var/lib/lightdm -s /bin/lightdm -u 800 -g 800 lightdm
